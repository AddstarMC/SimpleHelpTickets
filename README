Contributions Welcome.
 - Expiration on playerjoin currently broken, have a crack if you like. :)
 
 To the kiddies who used my source to make a competing plugin and then contacted me to tell me I was 'Going Down'
 A) Grow up
 B) Try directing your efforts to contributing, instead of competing. It's far better for the community.
 C) I make these plugins for my server, and share with with the community because I'm nice like that (And they're fantastic bug-testers)
 D) Funny how your plugin stopped advancing when I stopped uploading source changes, isn't it?....Keep that in mind.
 E) I can easily report you to BukkitDev for license violations and have any more of your 'competing' plugins removed, I chose to stop source updates instead to teach you a valuable lesson about the Open Source community... 
 However try me again and I won't hesitate to file a report.

 
 To Everyone Else:
 My apologies for the lack of source updates! 
 I'll keep things regularly updated from now on! :)
 
 Feel Free to contribute, I haven't time at the moment to fix ticket expirations (PListener) due to work obligations, so if you manage it I'll be your best friend and we can has cake and happytimes. :P
 
Cheers guys
